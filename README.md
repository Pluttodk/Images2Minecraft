# Converting Images Into Minecraft Houses
In this particular project, we turned a 2D Image into Minecraft pixel art and then scaled it in 3D such that it became possible to live in it. An actual Minecraft House. 

This was part of a youtube video over on:

## How to use
The code can be run by installing Python3.8
Great tutorial on that:
[Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-install-python-in-windows)

Change the parameters in the file `Image2House.py` to what ever you want it to be (these can be tweaked)

Then you run the file `Image2House.py` by typing the following in you terminal
```python Image2House.py```

Swap to Minecraft and watch it automatically build a beautiful house.
